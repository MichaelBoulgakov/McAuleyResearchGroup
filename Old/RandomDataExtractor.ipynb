This is a big deal and a primary reason for that fifth star.

I was very skeptical over this item but having heard the Cooks County review and reading other reviews here, I thought I'd get it for my wife to use.To my great surprise this thing works great. A very dull knife may require several aggressive swipes to get a good edge, but a knife with an already decent edge will quickly be very sharp. On a dull knife there will be some shavings which at first disturbed me, but I realized I probably would be taking off the same amount using my diamond stone to get a new edge. The big difference is this tool did it in seconds and no skill was required.I quickly realized that the trick is to go very gently at first. Let the tool set the edge. Once it sets a reasonably sharp edge, a few very light swipes will create close to a razor edge. If you are a nut like me and appreciate a true razor edge, a few passes on a fine stone and a light stropping will do the job.I also found that while it will get a good edge on even a cheap knife, good blades will develop a sharper, finer much longer lasting edge.I cannot attest to how long this tool will last. I now have sharpened several dozen knives of all types of steel and it has yet to quit. I use a honing steel each time I use a knife to maintain the edge, and that may lessen the number of times I need to use this tool. So it seems like it will last for a year or more.

An effective knife for cooking will have a microscopic burr on one side so that it effectively SLICES the food.  That is actually what a steel does.

I used a silicon based caulk to cover screw heads and seams.Light is only adjustable up / down so getting the light to face where you want may involve mounting additional hardware.Adjustable settings have considerable hysteresis.  (I was up and down a ladder many times)I bought three of these; two of them took considerable time (15+ minutes) to start turning off in Auto mode, even with the sensitivity and time adjustments minimized.  The third worked as soon as the switch was turned.  All three had been given the same amount of time to charge beforehand (5 days).I took one star for setup because I had almost given up on two of the three purchased.  The adjustment settings were initially unresponsive and the lights just stayed on in Auto mode.  When they finally turned off, everything started working as indicated.  The adjustment knobs are not linear, so I recommend getting a second person to perform a walking test so that the first can stay on the ladder to tweak the settings.  Also recommend using some sealant on the mounting hardware to keep it from rusting.  I kept picturing two years from now: we're inside and something hits the side of our house and it looks like someone is shining a flashlight in the window as one of these lights breaks away and dangles from the power cord because of cheap hardware.Once we were able to move beyond the setup and enjoy them, these lights redeemed some stars for how bright they are and the fact that they're solar with motion detection.  I truly didn't expect the intensity to be this good and to last for so long.  I'm sure this will vary with the availability of optimal charging sunlight, but the performance, brightness, function, and price are well worth it so far.FYI - the solar cell mounts to a ball-joint bracket on one of the long sides.  The quickest comparison that comes to mind is the rearview mirror in a car.  Except the range of movement is better on the solar cell.  360 degrees of rotation, and 180 degrees of tilt.  Combine this with the length of power cord supplied and you have greater latitude on where you can install everything.Very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to others.
